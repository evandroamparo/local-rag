Numerous\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht\u22121and the input for position t. This inherently\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples.",

However, both strategies have their limitations, especially in a large-scale and\nlatency-sensitive production scenario.\nAdapter Layers Introduce Inference Latency There are many variants of adapters. We focus\non the original design by Houlsby et al. (2019) which has two adapter layers per Transformer block\nand a more recent one by Lin et al. (2020) which has only one per block but with an additional\nLayerNorm (Ba et al., 2016). While one can reduce the overall latency by pruning layers or exploit-\ning multi-task settings (R \u00a8uckl\u00b4e et al., 2020; Pfeiffer et al., 2021), there is no direct ways to bypass\nthe extra compute in adapter layers.",

This seems like a non-issue since adapter layers are designed\nto have few parameters (sometimes <1% of the original model) by having a small bottleneck di-\nmension, which limits the FLOPs they can add. However, large neural networks rely on hardware\nparallelism to keep the latency low, and adapter layers have to be processed sequentially. This makes\na difference in the online inference setting where the batch size is typically as small as one. In a\ngeneric scenario without model parallelism, such as running inference on GPT-2 (Radford et al., b)\nmedium on a single GPU, we see a noticeable increase in latency when using adapters, even with a\nvery small bottleneck dimension (Table 1).\nThis problem gets worse when we need to shard the model as done in Shoeybi et al.

In the Transformer architecture, there are four weight matrices in\nthe self-attention module ( Wq;Wk;Wv;Wo) and two in the MLP module. We treat Wq(orWk,Wv)\nas a single matrix of dimension dmodel\u0002dmodel , even though the output dimension is usually sliced\ninto attention heads. We limit our study to only adapting the attention weights for downstream\ntasks and freeze the MLP modules (so they are not trained in downstream tasks) both for simplicity\nand parameter-ef\ufb01ciency.We further study the effect on adapting different types of attention weight\nmatrices in a Transformer in Section 7.1.

To ensure a fair comparison, we make two crucial changes to how we evaluate LoRA when\ncomparing with adapters. First, we use the same batch size for all tasks and use a sequence length\nof 128 to match the adapter baselines. Second, we initialize the model to the pre-trained model for\nMRPC, RTE, and STS-B, not a model already adapted to MNLI like the \ufb01ne-tuning baseline. Runs\nfollowing this more restricted setup from Houlsby et al. (2019) are labeled with y. The result is\npresented in Table 2 (Top Three Sections).

Consequently,\nadapter layers must be computed in addition to the base model, inevitably introducing additional\nlatency. While as pointed out in R \u00a8uckl\u00b4e et al. (2020), the latency introduced by adapter layers can\nbe mitigated when the model batch size and/or sequence length is large enough to full utilize the\nhardware parallelism.
